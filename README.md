https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux

I downloaded the flutter_linux_3.16.0-stable.tar.xz

extracted it to HOME directory and then executed

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
```

Add this line to your bash script to make it permanent. 


I then installed JDK (openjdk)

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk
```


I then installed Android Studio from snap

```bash
sudo snap install android-studio --classic
```
